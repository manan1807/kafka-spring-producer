# kafka-spring-producer
 An application that is the source of the data stream is what we call a producer. In order to generate tokens or messages and further publish it to one or more topics in the Kafka Cluster, we use Apache Kafka Producer.
Also the Producer API from Kafka helps to pack the message and deliver it to Kafka Server.
